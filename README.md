## The Name "Nu-Swing"

From a blog-post on the oracle website about the [naming of *Swing*](https://blogs.oracle.com/thejavatutorials/why-is-swing-called-swing) we find this excerpt:

*"... Finally after lunch, while driving back to Sun, Amy Fowler (lead engineer of the team) asked our most hip team member, Georges Saab, "Georges, you know what's up and coming... what's the new happening thing in San Francisco?"*

*Georges responded with "Swing dancing is getting to be really big." And that was it, we all knew it was perfect. When we got back to the office I did a global search and replace of "kfc" with "swing", and the rest is history.".*

Since *Swing* is named after the Jazz genre of Swing, and *Nu-Swing* is based on *Swing*, I thought it would be fun to do a little play on the name and continue the "tradition". 

As it happens there is genre called Nu Swing, also referred to as Neo Swing or Swing Revival, or more commonly Electro Swing. Of all these names I thought *Nu-Swing* sounded the best, and thus *Nu-Swing* got the name.

Let's get *Nu-Swinging*: [Lone Digger by Caravan Palace](https://youtu.be/UbQgXeY_zi4)
